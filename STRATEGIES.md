# Stackr: Accumulation Strategy Ideas

This document outlines 10 future-ready accumulation strategies. These are **concept-focused** and can be implemented as modular `strategyId` modules within Stackr. Effectiveness insights are based on backtesting where available.

## 1. Power Law 95th Percentile (Baseline)

- **Method**: Compare current price to theoretical power-law model (`modelPrice = A Ã— daysSinceGenesis^B`) and the 95th percentile band of historical prices.
- **Logic**:
  - If price < model â†’ **buy**, with higher multiplier for deeper undervaluation.
  - If price > 95th percentile â†’ **sell** or **hold**.
- **Effectiveness**: Bitboâ€™s Power Law Rainbow chart shows the long-term model aligns with Bitcoinâ€™s growth and measurable bounds :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

## 2. Power Law Regression Channel Oscillator

- **Method**: Log-linear regression with upper and lower bands around the power-law center.
- **Logic**:
  - Buy near lower band, hold near center, consider selling near upper band.

---

## 3. Onâ€‘Chain Metrics Accumulation

- **Metrics**: MVRV, SOPR, NUPL, net exchange flows :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- **Logic**:
  - Buy when metrics indicate undervaluation (e.g., MVRV < 1); multiplier scales with deviation depth.

---

## 4. HODL Wave Long-Term Accumulation

- **Method**: Analyze the UTXO age distribution ("HODL Waves").
- **Logic**:
  - Buy when long-term holder proportions shrink, indicating accumulation exhaustion.

---

## 5. Technical â€” 50â€‘Day MA Dip

- **Method**: Measure gap between current price and 50â€‘day moving average.
- **Logic**:
  - Buy when price falls X% below MA; multiplier scales with depth of dip.

---

## 6. Volatilityâ€‘Adjusted DCA

- **Method**: Use rolling volatility (standard deviation of returns).
- **Logic**:
  - Increase DCA amount proportionally during high volatility periods.

---

## 7. Sentiment & Fear & Greed Index

- **Method**: Use indices like Alternative.meâ€™s Fear & Greed.
- **Logic**:
  - Buy more during extreme fear, reduce or hold during greed.
- **Effectiveness**: A Reddit-sourced Fear & Greed strategy achieved 184% ROI vs. 125% for plain DCA :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

---

## 8. Multiâ€‘Model Ensemble Score

- **Method**: Aggregate sub-strategy scores (e.g., on-chain, technical, sentiment).
- **Logic**:
  - Buy when consensus surpasses threshold; multiplier reflects consensus strength.

---

## 9. Cycle Phase (Fourâ€‘Year Halving)

- **Method**: Determine position in BTC cycle (pre-/post-halving).
- **Logic**:
  - Heavier accumulation during cycle troughs.

---

## 10. Adaptive AI Strategy

- **Method**: Train ML (e.g., tree-based model) using historic triggers + performance.
- **Logic**:
  - Predict optimal buy actions and multipliers; retrain periodically.
- **Note**: Not Turing-full, but lightweight, privacy-respecting model.

## ðŸ§© Implementation Notes for Stackr

- Each of the strategies above can be added as a new `strategyId` in `strategies/` folder.
- Module interface: `evaluateStrategy(strategyId, â€¦) â†’ { action, multiplier }`.
- Backtest pipeline can later be developed using historical price + indicator feeds.
- The modular design allows combining or weighting strategies in an ensemble mode.

These ideas provide a roadmap for extending Stackrâ€™s intelligence layer beyond baseline DCA â€” adopting rich, data-driven, and repeatable accumulation strategies.
